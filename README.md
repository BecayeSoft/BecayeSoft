## My Most Interesting Repositories

- [Loan-Eligibility-Modeling](https://github.com/BecayeSoft/Loan-Eligibility-Modeling): An interpretable system to assess loan eligibility in which I used machine learning to predict loan eligibility and GPT-3.5 to generate a report explaining the model's decision.

- [Intel-images-classification](https://github.com/BecayeSoft/Intel-images-classification): A comparison between Transfer Learning and a custom Convolutional Network to classify images.

- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/BecayeSoft/Machine-Learning): Deep learning, machine learning marvels, and language sorcery in one repository :)

- [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/BecayeSoft/Natural-Language-Processing): The sorcery of Natural Language processing form basic techniques such as Word2Vec, Topic Modelling to LSTMs, and pre-trained transformers.
